      "What an awesome weekend! Did something I've bn scared of my whole life. I trusted myself in the water and I learned to swim. Cause hunni this was hard for me. And honestly It was not bad. We were never taught to swim as kids. Both my children know how to swim. I had to get over this fear. ..Now I'm still not gonna go jump into no deep deep water but, hey I will atleast enjoy the activity involving water. S/O to my girl Christin Mitchell..the most patient instructor in the world. Book her for ur leasons...Oh and I swam in the 9ft and jumped off the diving board into the 9ft..I'll be 42yrsold in a few weeks and I'm no longer putting limits on myself.Trying new things, knowing down boundaries, and enjoying myl life...And I was up at 5:20am and cooked dinner for my mom and family...I'm winning all the way around.",
